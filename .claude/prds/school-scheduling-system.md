# PRD: School Scheduling System

## Executive Summary

A university-level automated course scheduling system that replaces manual scheduling processes with an intelligent optimization engine. The system will handle 500 teachers, 20,000 students, and 150 classrooms across various departments, minimizing scheduling conflicts while enforcing institutional constraints. Built with SpringBoot backend using MyBatis for data persistence and Vue3 frontend with Shadcn UI components

## Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**
- Manual scheduling process is time-consuming and error-prone
- High frequency of scheduling conflicts between teacher availability and student course demands
- Inefficient utilization of classroom capacity and teaching resources
- Difficulty managing complex constraints (prerequisites, teacher specialization, room capacity)
- Lack of centralized visibility into scheduling conflicts and resource allocation

**Why Now:**
- Growing student population exacerbates manual scheduling limitations
- Need for optimization to maximize resource utilization
- Desire for data-driven scheduling decisions
- Administrative burden reduction required for institutional efficiency

## User Stories

### Primary User: Administrator
- As an administrator, I need to input teacher availability, course requirements, and classroom capacities so the system can generate conflict-free schedules
- As an administrator, I need to view and resolve scheduling conflicts manually when automated resolution fails
- As an administrator, I need to adjust scheduling parameters and constraints to meet changing institutional needs
- As an administrator, I need to generate reports on resource utilization and scheduling efficiency

### Secondary User: Teacher
- As a teacher, I need to set my availability preferences and teaching constraints
- As a teacher, I need to view my assigned teaching schedule and room assignments
- As a teacher, I need to request schedule changes through the system

### Tertiary User: Student (Future Scope)
- As a student, I need to view course schedules and plan my academic path
- As a student, I need to see which courses have available capacity
- As a student, I need to understand prerequisite requirements for course enrollment

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Scheduling Engine (MVP)
- **Automated Scheduling**: Generate course schedules based on multiple constraints
- **Conflict Detection**: Identify and flag teacher time conflicts, classroom double-booking, and student course overlaps
- **Constraint Management**: Enforce teacher availability, classroom capacity, and subject prerequisites
- **Manual Override**: Allow administrators to manually adjust and override automated scheduling decisions
- **Schedule Export**: Export schedules in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, Calendar)

#### Data Management (MVP)
- **Teacher Management**: Add, edit, and manage teacher profiles with availability and specialization
- **Course Management**: Define courses with capacity limits, prerequisites, and room requirements
- **Classroom Management**: Manage classroom inventory with capacity and equipment specifications
- **Department Management**: Organize courses and teachers by academic departments

#### Reporting & Analytics (Phase 2)
- **Utilization Reports**: Track classroom and teacher utilization rates
- **Conflict Analysis**: Report on scheduling conflicts and resolution patterns
- **Capacity Planning**: Forecast resource needs based on enrollment trends
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure scheduling efficiency and optimization success

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Schedule generation for 20,000 students within 30 minutes
- Support concurrent access for 50+ administrators during peak scheduling periods
- Real-time conflict detection with sub-second response time
- Database queries returning results within 3 seconds

#### Security
- Role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student)
- Secure password storage and session management
- Audit logging for all schedule changes and administrative actions
- Data validation to prevent invalid schedule entries

#### Scalability
- System architecture supporting growth to 50,000 students
- Database schema optimized for scheduling queries and conflict detection
- Modular design allowing addition of new constraints and rules
- API design supporting future mobile applications

#### Usability
- Intuitive dashboard for administrators to manage scheduling using Shadcn UI components (Card, Table, Form, Dialog)
- Clear visual indicators for conflicts and constraint violations using Shadcn Badge, Alert, and Button components
- Responsive design working on desktop and tablet devices with Shadcn responsive layout components
- Comprehensive search and filtering capabilities using Shadcn Input, Select, and Calendar components

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Scheduling Efficiency**: Reduce scheduling time from weeks to hours
- **Conflict Resolution**: Achieve 95% automated conflict resolution rate
- **Resource Utilization**: Increase classroom utilization from 70% to 85%
- **User Satisfaction**: Achieve 80% user satisfaction score within 6 months

### Qualitative Metrics
- Administrator confidence in automated scheduling decisions
- Teacher satisfaction with assigned schedules and workload distribution
- Reduction in manual scheduling errors and last-minute changes
- Improved visibility into institutional resource allocation

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: SpringBoot (backend), MyBatis (persistence), Vue3 + Shadcn (frontend), MySQL database
- **Deployment**: On-premises server deployment
- **Access**: Desktop web browser access only (Phase 1)
