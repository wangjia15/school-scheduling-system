## Description
Implement role-based access control system with JWT authentication for different user types.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication
- [ ] Create role-based authorization system
- [ ] Define user roles and permissions
- [ ] Create authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement security configurations

## Technical Implementation
- Use Spring Security with JWT
- Implement custom UserDetailsService
- Create JWT token management
- Add method-level security
- Implement password encryption

## Implementation Steps
1. **Define security model** (2-3 hours)
   - User roles (ADMIN, TEACHER, STUDENT, PARENT)
   - Permission matrix
   - Authentication flow design
   - Security configurations

2. **Implement JWT authentication** (4-5 hours)
   - JWT token generation/validation
   - Authentication filters
   - UserDetailsService implementation
   - Password encryption
   - Token refresh mechanism

3. **Create user management** (3-4 hours)
   - User registration/login
   - Profile management
   - Role assignment
   - Account status management

4. **Build authorization system** (3-4 hours)
   - Method-level security
   - URL-based security
   - Custom permission evaluators
   - Access control lists

5. **Create security endpoints** (2-3 hours)
   - Login endpoint
   - Registration endpoint
   - Token refresh endpoint
   - Password management

6. **Add security features** (2 hours)
   - Rate limiting
   - Session management
   - Security headers
   - CORS configuration

## Deliverables
- JWT authentication implementation
- Role-based authorization system
- User management endpoints
- Security configurations
- Authentication service classes
- Security tests

## Testing Requirements
- Authentication flow tests
- Authorization test cases
- Security vulnerability tests
- Performance tests for auth endpoints
- Integration tests with frontend

## Notes
- Use industry-standard security practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Consider social login integration
- Plan for multi-tenancy requirements
