## Description
Design and implement normalized database schema for scheduling entities including courses, teachers, students, classrooms, and schedules.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create normalized database schema for scheduling entities
- [ ] Define primary and foreign key relationships
- [ ] Implement proper indexing strategy
- [ ] Add constraints and validation rules
- [ ] Document schema with ERD

## Technical Implementation
- Use PostgreSQL database
- Implement schema with migrations
- Add proper indexes for performance
- Include audit timestamps
- Add check constraints for data integrity

## Implementation Steps
1. **Research existing scheduling patterns** (1-2 hours)
   - Study common scheduling database designs
   - Analyze normalization requirements
   - Identify performance considerations

2. **Design core entities** (3-4 hours)
   - Courses table with metadata
   - Teachers table with specializations
   - Students table with enrollment info
   - Classrooms table with capacity/features
   - Schedules table with time slots

3. **Define relationships** (2-3 hours)
   - Course-teacher assignments
   - Student-course enrollments
   - Classroom-schedule mappings
   - Many-to-many relationships

4. **Add constraints and validation** (2 hours)
   - Time conflict prevention
   - Capacity limits
   - Prerequisites validation
   - Business rule constraints

5. **Create migration scripts** (2 hours)
   - Initial schema creation
   - Index creation
   - Constraint setup
   - Test data seeding

6. **Performance optimization** (2 hours)
   - Index analysis
   - Query optimization
   - Connection pooling setup

## Deliverables
- Database schema SQL files
- Entity relationship diagram
- Migration scripts
- Performance benchmarks
- Schema documentation

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for constraint validation
- Integration tests for CRUD operations
- Performance tests for query optimization
- Data integrity validation tests

## Notes
- Focus on third normal form
- Consider future scalability
- Include soft delete capability
- Plan for reporting requirements
