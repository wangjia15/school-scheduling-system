# Task: MyBatis Mappers

## Description
Create a comprehensive data access layer using MyBatis with optimized SQL queries for scheduling operations. Implement mappers for all domain entities with proper transaction management and performance optimization for large datasets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MyBatis mapper interfaces created for all domain entities (Teacher, Course, Classroom, Schedule, Constraint, Conflict)
- [ ] XML mapper files with optimized SQL queries for complex scheduling operations
- [ ] Batch operations support for bulk data processing
- [ ] Transaction management properly configured with rollback behavior
- [ ] Query performance optimized with proper indexing support
- [ ] Database connection pooling configured for high concurrency
- [ ] Integration tests for all mapper operations with test data
- [ ] Documentation of all queries and their performance characteristics

## Technical Details
- **MyBatis 3.x** configuration with SpringBoot integration
- **Mapper interfaces** using annotations and XML mapping files
- **Dynamic SQL** for complex scheduling constraint validation
- **Batch operations** for bulk data imports and updates
- **Result mapping** for complex domain object relationships
- **Cache configuration** for frequently accessed data
- **Named parameter binding** for type-safe queries
- **Transaction propagation** configured appropriately

**Key Mappers to Implement:**
- `TeacherMapper` - CRUD operations, availability queries, specialization searches
- `CourseMapper` - CRUD operations, prerequisite validation, capacity checks
- `ClassroomMapper` - CRUD operations, availability tracking, equipment searches
- `ScheduleMapper` - Complex scheduling queries, conflict detection, time slot management
- `ConstraintMapper` - Configuration management, rule validation
- `ConflictMapper` - Conflict logging, resolution tracking, reporting

**Performance Considerations:**
- Composite indexes for scheduling queries
- Partition-aware queries for large datasets
- Optimized joins for relationship queries
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Proper connection pooling configuration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Database Schema Design completed
- [ ] Task 002: Core Domain Models completed
- [ ] MySQL database server configured
- [ ] MyBatis SpringBoot starter dependency
- [ ] Database connection pool (HikariCP) configured

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M (Medium)
- **Hours**: 40 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can work alongside other tasks that don't modify database schema)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All mapper interfaces and XML files implemented
- [ ] Integration tests with 80% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (< 3 seconds for complex queries)
- [ ] Documentation complete with query examples
- [ ] Code review passed
- [ ] Database schema migration scripts tested
- [ ] Connection pooling configuration validated
