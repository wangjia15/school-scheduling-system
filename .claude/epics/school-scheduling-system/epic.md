# Epic: School Scheduling System

## Overview

A comprehensive university course scheduling system that automates the complex process of assigning teachers, courses, and classrooms while minimizing conflicts and optimizing resource utilization. The system will handle 500 teachers, 20,000 students, and 150 classrooms using a constraint-based optimization approach. Implementation follows a phased approach with MVP delivering core scheduling functionality.

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack Selection
- **SpringBoot 3.x** for backend - proven enterprise framework with robust ecosystem
- **MyBatis** for persistence - fine-grained SQL control over complex scheduling queries
- **Vue3 + Composition API** for frontend - modern reactive framework with TypeScript support
- **Shadcn UI** for component library - consistent, accessible UI components with Tailwind CSS
- **MySQL 8.x** for database - reliable relational database with strong transaction support

### Architecture Patterns
- **Clean Architecture** - separation of concerns between business logic and infrastructure
- **Domain-Driven Design** - rich domain models for scheduling constraints and business rules
- **CQRS Pattern** - separate read and write models for scheduling operations
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - for conflict detection and resolution notifications

### Key Design Decisions
- **Constraint-Based Scheduling Engine** - pluggable constraint system for flexible rule enforcement
- **Modular Component Design** - independent modules for teachers, courses, classrooms, and scheduling
- **RESTful API Design** - standardized endpoints with proper HTTP status codes
- **Real-Time Conflict Detection** - WebSocket-based conflict notifications
- **Responsive UI Design** - desktop-first with tablet support using Shadcn responsive components

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

#### Core UI Architecture
- **Vue3 + Composition API** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Pinia** for state management - centralized store for scheduling data and conflicts
- **Vue Router** for SPA navigation - role-based route protection
- **Shadcn UI Components** - Card, Table, Form, Dialog, Badge, Alert, Input, Select, Calendar

#### Key Frontend Modules
- **Administrator Dashboard** - overview of scheduling status and conflicts
- **Teacher Management** - CRUD operations with availability calendars
- **Course Management** - course definitions with prerequisite trees
- **Classroom Management** - room inventory with capacity and equipment tracking
- **Schedule Visualization** - interactive calendar and timetable views
- **Conflict Resolution** - dedicated interface for manual conflict handling

#### State Management Strategy
- **Global State** - scheduling periods, current user, system configuration
- **Module State** - teacher data, course catalog, classroom inventory
- **Component State** - form inputs, filter states, UI interactions
- **Real-Time Updates** - WebSocket connections for live conflict detection

### Backend Services

#### API Architecture
