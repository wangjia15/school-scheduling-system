## Description
Implement comprehensive teacher management module with CRUD operations, availability calendars, and scheduling preferences integrated with the main scheduling system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create teacher profile management system
- [ ] Implement full CRUD operations
- [ ] Build availability calendar interface
- [ ] Add scheduling preferences
- [ ] Integrate with course assignments
- [ ] Support teacher workload management
- [ ] Add availability conflict detection
- [ ] Implement bulk teacher operations

## Technical Implementation
- Build RESTful API for teacher management
- Create calendar component for availability
- Implement real-time conflict detection
- Add comprehensive validation
- Include audit logging for changes
- Support data import/export

## Implementation Steps
1. **Design teacher data model** (2-3 hours)
   - Teacher profile schema
   - Availability patterns
   - Scheduling preferences
   - Workload tracking
   - Integration points

2. **Build CRUD API endpoints** (3-4 hours)
   - Create/read/update/delete teachers
   - Validation middleware
   - Error handling
   - Pagination and filtering
   - Bulk operations

3. **Implement availability system** (4-5 hours)
   - Recurring availability patterns
   - Exception handling (sick days, vacations)
   - Time zone support
   - Availability validation
   - Conflict detection

4. **Create calendar interface** (3-4 hours)
   - Interactive calendar component
   - Availability editing
   - Pattern management
   - Visual conflict indicators
   - Bulk availability updates

5. **Add scheduling preferences** (3-4 hours)
   - Preferred time slots
   - Course preferences
   - Classroom preferences
   - Workload limits
   - Break preferences

6. **Integrate with scheduling system** (2-3 hours)
   - Teacher-course assignments
   - Schedule generation integration
   - Real-time conflict updates
   - Workload monitoring
   - Performance optimization

## Deliverables
- Complete teacher management API
- Availability calendar interface
- Scheduling preferences system
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Integration documentation

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all API endpoints
- Integration tests with scheduling system
- UI component testing
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Data validation testing
- Conflict detection accuracy testing

## Notes
- Ensure data privacy and security
- Provide clear user feedback
- Support different teacher contract types
- Consider part-time and full-time variations
- Include comprehensive audit trails
