description: Course definitions with prerequisite trees and comprehensive course catalog management
---

## Task Overview
Implement a robust course management module that handles course definitions, prerequisite structures, and comprehensive course catalog management for the scheduling system.

## Requirements

### Core Features
- Course catalog management with hierarchical organization
- Prerequisite tree management and validation
- Course attribute and metadata management
- Version control for course changes
- Course approval workflow system

### Technical Specifications
- Graph-based prerequisite relationship management
- Circular dependency detection
- Course search and filtering capabilities
- Bulk course operations and imports
- Course lifecycle management (draft, active, archived, retired)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Course Management
- Implement course CRUD operations
- Create course attribute system
- Build hierarchical course organization
- Develop course search and filtering
- Set up course validation rules

### Phase 2: Prerequisite Management
- Implement prerequisite tree structure
- Create prerequisite validation engine
- Add circular dependency detection
- Develop prerequisite impact analysis
- Build prerequisite visualization tools

### Phase 3: Course Lifecycle
- Implement course approval workflows
- Create version control system
- Add course archival and retirement
- Develop change tracking and audit
- Build course history and timeline

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Implement bulk course operations
- Create course import/export functionality
- Add course analytics and reporting
- Develop course recommendation engine
- Build course planning tools

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Create and manage course definitions with full metadata
- [ ] Build and visualize prerequisite trees with validation
- [ ] Detect and prevent circular dependencies
- [ ] Implement course approval workflows
- [ ] Support course version control and history
- [ ] Provide advanced course search and filtering
- [ ] Enable bulk course operations
- [ ] Generate course catalog and reports

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Handle course operations within 500ms response time
- [ ] Support prerequisite validation for 1000+ courses
- [ ] Process bulk operations for 500+ courses
- [ ] Maintain performance with complex prerequisite trees
- [ ] Support concurrent course management operations

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Integrate with Course Management (006)
- [ ] Connect to scheduling system for course assignments
- [ ] Support prerequisite validation during scheduling
- [ ] Provide API endpoints for external systems
- [ ] Enable course data synchronization

## Dependencies
- Course Management (006)

## Success Metrics
- 100% prerequisite validation accuracy
- Average course creation time under 5 minutes
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5 for course management
- Zero circular dependency errors in production

## Notes
This module forms the foundation for the entire scheduling system. Course definitions and prerequisite structures are critical for ensuring valid and conflict-free schedules. The system should be flexible enough to handle various academic structures while maintaining data integrity and validation rules.
