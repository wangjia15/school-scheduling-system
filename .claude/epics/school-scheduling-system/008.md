## Description
Design and implement a constraint-based optimization engine for automatic school schedule generation that handles teacher availability, classroom capacity, course prerequisites, and student enrollments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement constraint-based scheduling algorithm
- [ ] Handle teacher availability conflicts
- [ ] Optimize classroom utilization
- [ ] Process course prerequisites
- [ ] Generate optimal schedules automatically
- [ ] Provide manual override capabilities
- [ ] Support different scheduling strategies

## Technical Implementation
- Use constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) algorithms
- Implement backtracking with forward checking
- Add conflict detection and resolution
- Include performance optimization for large datasets
- Support both automatic and manual scheduling modes

## Implementation Steps
1. **Research scheduling algorithms** (2-3 hours)
   - Study constraint satisfaction problems
   - Analyze existing scheduling algorithms
   - Evaluate performance requirements

2. **Design constraint model** (3-4 hours)
   - Define hard constraints (must satisfy)
   - Define soft constraints (preferences)
   - Create constraint validation framework
   - Design conflict detection system

3. **Implement core algorithm** (4-5 hours)
   - Backtracking algorithm with forward checking
   - Constraint propagation
   - Variable and value ordering heuristics
   - Optimization scoring system

4. **Add conflict resolution** (3-4 hours)
   - Conflict detection algorithms
   - Resolution strategies
   - Manual override system
   - Conflict reporting and visualization

5. **Optimize performance** (3-4 hours)
   - Memoization and caching
   - Parallel processing for independent constraints
   - Incremental constraint checking
   - Performance profiling and tuning

6. **Create scheduling strategies** (2-3 hours)
   - Greedy optimization
   - Genetic algorithm approach
   - Local search methods
   - Hybrid approaches

## Deliverables
- Constraint-based scheduling engine
- Algorithm implementation with unit tests
