# Task: REST API Development

## Description
Build comprehensive RESTful API endpoints for the school scheduling system following REST principles. Implement controllers, DTOs, and proper HTTP status handling with Swagger documentation and API versioning support.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] REST controllers implemented for all domain entities (Teacher, Course, Classroom, Schedule)
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes and error handling for all endpoints
- [ ] DTO classes for request/response data transfer with validation
- [ ] API versioning implemented (/api/v1/, /api/v2/)
- [ ] Swagger/OpenAPI documentation generated automatically
- [ ] Pagination and filtering support for large data sets
- [ ] Rate limiting and security headers configured
- [ ] Integration tests for all endpoints with 90% coverage
- [ ] API response format standardized across all endpoints

## Technical Details
- **SpringBoot Web** with MVC configuration
- **Spring Validation** for request parameter validation
- **Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0** for API documentation
- **Spring HATEOAS** for hypermedia links
- **Jackson** for JSON serialization/deserialization
- **Spring Data REST** where appropriate
- **Global exception handling** with custom error responses

**Key Controllers to Implement:**
- `TeacherController` - CRUD operations, availability management
- `CourseController` - CRUD operations, prerequisite validation, capacity management
- `ClassroomController` - CRUD operations, availability tracking
- `ScheduleController` - Schedule generation, conflict checking, retrieval
- `AdminController` - System configuration, bulk operations
- `ReportController` - Schedule exports, utilization reports

**Endpoint Examples:**
```
GET    /api/v1/teachers
POST   /api/v1/teachers
GET    /api/v1/teachers/{id}
PUT    /api/v1/teachers/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/teachers/{id}

GET    /api/v1/schedules/generate
POST   /api/v1/schedules/conflicts/check
GET    /api/v1/reports/utilization
GET    /api/v1/export/schedules/pdf
```

**Security & Validation:**
- Input validation with Bean Validation annotations
- Custom validators for complex business rules
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration for frontend access
- API key authentication for external integrations

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Core Domain Models completed
- [ ] Task 005: MyBatis Mappers completed
- [ ] SpringBoot Web dependency
- [ ] Swagger/OpenAPI dependency
- [ ] Validation framework configured

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Hours**: 60 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can work alongside frontend development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All controllers and DTOs implemented
- [ ] API documentation generated and accessible
- [ ] Integration tests with 90% coverage
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (< 1 second response time)
- [ ] Security scanning completed
- [ ] Code review passed
- [ ] API contract validated with frontend team
- [ ] Load testing completed for 50+ concurrent users
