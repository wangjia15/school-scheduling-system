# MyBatis Mappers Implementation Progress

## Issue #005: MyBatis Mappers

### Progress Overview
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Start Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-19

### Completed Tasks

#### Core Infrastructure
- [x] MyBatis configuration verified in application.yml
- [x] Dependencies confirmed in pom.xml
- [x] Directory structure planning

#### Mapper Implementation
- [x] TeacherMapper interface and XML with advanced availability and workload queries
- [x] CourseMapper interface and XML with prerequisite validation and capacity management
- [x] ClassroomMapper interface and XML with equipment search and utilization analytics
- [x] ScheduleMapper interface and XML with complex conflict detection algorithms
- [x] ConstraintMapper interface and XML with JSON-based configuration management

#### Key Features to Implement
1. **Complex Scheduling Queries**: Optimized SQL for constraint validation
2. **Batch Operations**: Bulk data processing for imports/exports
3. **Performance Optimization**: Composite indexes and query optimization
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Proper handling of complex domain relationships
5. **Transaction Management**: Proper rollback behavior

#### Performance Considerations
- Query optimization for 20K+ student datasets
- Proper indexing strategy
- Connection pooling configuration
- Batch processing for large operations

### Issues Encountered
- None yet

### Next Steps
1. Create TeacherMapper as first priority
2. Implement CourseMapper with prerequisite queries
3. Create ScheduleMapper with conflict detection
4. Add complex constraint validation queries
5. Implement batch operations
6. Create comprehensive integration tests

### Notes
- Using MyBatis 3.0.3 with Spring Boot 3.2.0
- XML mapper files in `resources/mapper/` directory
- Type aliases configured for domain objects
- HikariCP connection pooling configured
