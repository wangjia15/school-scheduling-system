# Issue #011 - Conflict Detection System - Stream A Progress

## Date: 2025-09-19

### Completed Tasks ✅

1. **Backend Core Services**
   - ✅ ConflictDetectionService with comprehensive conflict detection algorithms
   - ✅ ConflictController with REST endpoints for conflict management
   - ✅ WebSocket service for real-time notifications
   - ✅ ConflictAnalyticsService for trend analysis and reporting
   - ✅ ConflictNotificationService for broadcasting conflict updates

2. **Frontend Real-Time Updates**
   - ✅ Enhanced WebSocket service with conflict-specific message types
   - ✅ Updated ConflictList component with real-time updates
   - ✅ Created RealTimeConflictDashboard component
   - ✅ Live/offline toggle and connection status monitoring
