description: Real-time conflict identification and notification for schedule assignments
---

## Task Overview
Implement a comprehensive conflict detection system that automatically identifies scheduling conflicts in real-time and provides proactive notifications to prevent scheduling errors.

## Requirements

### Core Features
- Real-time conflict detection during schedule creation and modification
- Multiple conflict type detection (time, resource, instructor, room)
- Proactive notification system for conflicts
- Conflict resolution suggestions
- Historical conflict tracking and reporting

### Technical Specifications
- Conflict detection algorithms for various scenarios
- Real-time validation hooks
- Notification system integration
- Conflict severity levels and prioritization
- Performance optimization for high-volume schedules

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Conflict Detection Engine
- Implement core conflict detection algorithms
- Create validation hooks for schedule operations
- Set up conflict severity classification system
- Develop real-time validation pipeline

### Phase 2: Notification System
- Design and implement notification framework
- Create notification templates and severity levels
- Set up delivery mechanisms (in-app, email, push)
- Implement user notification preferences

### Phase 3: Conflict Resolution
- Develop conflict resolution suggestion engine
- Create interactive conflict resolution interface
- Implement automatic conflict resolution for simple cases
- Add manual override capabilities

### Phase 4: Analytics and Reporting
- Create conflict analytics dashboard
- Implement historical conflict tracking
- Develop conflict trend analysis
- Generate conflict resolution efficiency reports

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Detect time conflicts between overlapping schedule items
- [ ] Identify instructor scheduling conflicts
- [ ] Detect room allocation conflicts
- [ ] Recognize resource conflicts (equipment, facilities)
- [ ] Provide real-time conflict alerts during scheduling
- [ ] Generate conflict severity scores
- [ ] Offer resolution suggestions
- [ ] Track conflict resolution outcomes

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Process conflict detection within 500ms
- [ ] Handle 1000+ concurrent schedule validations
- [ ] Support real-time conflict detection for large datasets
- [ ] Maintain performance with complex dependency trees

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Integrate with existing scheduling system
- [ ] Connect to notification infrastructure
- [ ] Support multiple data sources for conflict detection
- [ ] Provide API endpoints for external systems

## Dependencies
- Schedule Management System (008)

## Success Metrics
- 95% reduction in scheduling conflicts post-implementation
- Average conflict resolution time under 5 minutes
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5 for conflict detection accuracy
- System performance maintaining < 1s response time

## Notes
This task focuses on preventing scheduling errors before they occur. The system should be proactive rather than reactive, identifying potential conflicts during the scheduling process rather than after schedules are finalized.
