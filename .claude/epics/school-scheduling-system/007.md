# Task: Data Validation Services

## Description
Implement comprehensive data validation services for the school scheduling system, including input validation, business rule validation, and constraint validation for scheduling operations. Create reusable validation components that can be applied across different layers of the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Input validation implemented for all API endpoints using Bean Validation
- [ ] Custom validators for complex business rules (prerequisites, teacher availability, capacity limits)
- [ ] Constraint validation service for scheduling rules and limitations
- [ ] Real-time validation feedback with detailed error messages
- [ ] Validation rules externalized for easy maintenance
- [ ] Integration with Spring validation framework
- [ ] Performance optimized validation for bulk operations
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all validation scenarios
- [ ] Documentation of all validation rules and error codes

## Technical Details
- **Spring Validation** framework integration
- **Custom constraint validators** for business-specific rules
- **Validation groups** for different validation contexts
- **MessageSource** for internationalized error messages
- **Aspect-oriented programming** for cross-cutting validation concerns
- **Caching** for frequently accessed validation rules

**Key Validation Services:**
- `TeacherValidator` - Availability validation, specialization checks, workload limits
- `CourseValidator` - Prerequisite validation, capacity validation, time requirement checks
- `ClassroomValidator` - Capacity validation, equipment validation, availability checks
- `ScheduleValidator` - Conflict detection, time slot validation, constraint validation
- `ConstraintValidator` - Rule validation, parameter validation, business logic checks

**Validation Rules Examples:**
- Teacher cannot be assigned to concurrent time slots
- Course prerequisites must be satisfied
- Classroom capacity cannot be exceeded
- Teacher specialization must match course requirements
- Time slot conflicts must be prevented
- Business hours and institutional policies enforced

**Performance Considerations:**
- Lazy validation for complex rules
- Batch validation for bulk operations
- Caching of validation rules and constraints
- Asynchronous validation for non-blocking operations
- Optimized constraint checking algorithms

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Core Domain Models completed
- [ ] Spring Validation framework configured
- [ ] MessageSource for internationalization
- [ ] Caching infrastructure (Redis) available

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M (Medium)
- **Hours**: 35 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can work alongside other backend tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All validation services implemented and tested
- [ ] Custom validators registered with Spring validation framework
- [ ] Integration tests with 95% coverage for validation scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (< 100ms for single validation)
- [ ] Error messages documented and localized
- [ ] Code review passed
- [ ] Validation rules documented for administrators
- [ ] Integration with API endpoints complete
