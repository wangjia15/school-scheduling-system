## Description
Develop rich domain objects with business rules and validation for scheduling entities using SpringBoot.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create JPA entity classes for all domain objects
- [ ] Implement business validation rules
- [ ] Add domain service classes for complex logic
- [ ] Create DTO classes for API communication
- [ ] Implement repository interfaces

## Technical Implementation
- Use Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
- Implement domain-driven design patterns
- Add validation annotations
- Create custom validators
- Implement business logic in domain services

## Implementation Steps
1. **Create JPA entities** (4-5 hours)
   - Course entity with validation
   - Teacher entity with qualifications
   - Student entity with enrollment
   - Classroom entity with features
   - Schedule entity with time management

2. **Implement validation rules** (3-4 hours)
   - Course prerequisites validation
   - Teacher workload validation
   - Student enrollment limits
   - Classroom capacity validation
   - Schedule conflict detection

3. **Create domain services** (3-4 hours)
   - CourseManagementService
   - ScheduleValidationService
   - EnrollmentService
   - TeacherAssignmentService
   - ClassroomAllocationService

4. **Build DTO classes** (2-3 hours)
   - Request/response DTOs
   - Data transformation logic
   - Validation annotations
   - API documentation

5. **Implement repositories** (2-3 hours)
   - Custom query methods
   - Specification patterns
   - Pagination support
   - Search functionality

6. **Add integration logic** (2 hours)
   - Entity relationships
   - Cascade operations
   - Transaction management
   - Event handling

## Deliverables
- JPA entity classes
- Domain service classes
- DTO classes
- Repository interfaces
- Validation logic
- Unit tests

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all entities
- Integration tests for repositories
- Service layer tests
- Validation test cases
- Business logic verification

## Notes
- Follow domain-driven design principles
- Use constructor injection
- Implement proper transaction boundaries
- Consider audit logging requirements
